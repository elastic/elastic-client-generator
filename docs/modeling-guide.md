# Modeling Guide

The goal of the specification is to be used by different languages, from dynamically typed to statically typed.
To achieve this goal the specification contains a series of custom types that do not have a meaning
for the target language, but they should be translated to the most approriate construct.

The specification is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you can find all
the basic types [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).

### Dictionary

Represents a dynamic key value map:

```ts
property: Dictionary<string, TypeDefinition>
```

For example:

```json
{
  "property1": "type",
  "property2": "other-type",
}
```

### SingleKeyDictionary

Represents a dynamic key value map with a single top level key:

```ts
property: SingleKeyDictionary<string, TypeDefinition>
```

For example:

```json
{
  "onlyKey": "type"
}
```

### Array

Represents an array of the given value:

```ts
// generics syntax
property: Array<string>

// short syntax
property: string[]
```

### Union

Represents a type that can accept multiple types:

```ts
property: string | long
```

It can be combined with other types:
```ts
// array
property: Array<string | long>

// dictionary
property: Dictionary<string, string | long>
```

### Enum

Represents a set of allowed values:

```ts
enum MyEnum {
  first = 0,
  second = 1,
  third = 2
}

property: MyEnum
```

### User defined value

Represents a value that will be defined by the user and has no specific type.

```ts
property: UserDefinedValue
```

### Numbers

The numeric type in TypeScript is `number`, but given that this specification target mutliple languages,
it offers a bunch of alias that represents the type that should be used if the language supports it:

```ts
type short = number
type byte = number
type integer = number
type long = number
type float = number
type double = number
```

### Strings

The string type in TypeScript is `string`. It's ok to use it in the spec, but to offer a more developer
friendly specification, we do offer a set of aliases based on which string we do expect, for example:

```ts
type ScrollId = string
type ScrollIds = string
type CategoryId = string
type ActionIds = string
type Field = string
type Id = string | number
type Ids = string | number | string[]
type IndexName = string
type Indices = string | string[]
...
```

You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator/blob/update-docs/specification/specs/common.ts),
feel free to add more if it feels appropriate!

### Dates

The `Date` type in TypeScript refers to the JavaScript `Date` object,
since Elasticsearch needs a string or a numeric value, there are aliases also for date types:

```ts
type Timestamp = string
type TimeSpan = string
interface Date {}
```
