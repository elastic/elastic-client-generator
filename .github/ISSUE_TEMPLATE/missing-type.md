**Please read this entire template before posting any issue. If you ignore these instructions
and post an issue here that does not follow the instructions, your issue might be closed,
locked, and assigned the `invalid` label.**

It's not uncommon that somebody already opened an issue or in the best case it's already fixed but not merged. That's the reason why you should [search](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator/issues) at first before submitting a new one.

If you want to try adding the type yourself, you are most welcome!
Take a look at [our documentation](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator#how-to-validate-the-specification) to see how to do it.

## üêõ Missing type

The name of the API that is currently missing.

## Definition

If possible provide a basic definition that we can use as base.
You can see [here](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator/blob/master/docs/add-new-api.md) how to create a basic definition for any API.
