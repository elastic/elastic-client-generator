It's not uncommon that somebody already opened an issue or in the best case it's already fixed but not merged. That's the reason why you should [search](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator/labels/wrong%20type) at first before submitting a new one.

If you want to try fixing the type yourself, you are most welcome!
Take a look at [our documentation](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-client-generator#how-to-validate-the-specification) to see how to do it.
